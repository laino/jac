JAP - (It's) Just A Plot
========================

A library for simulations with large numbers of entities, without actually simulating all of them.

Instead of saving properties on individual entities, properties are treated as a polyline graph
which is simplified as needed - using an algorithm that preserves area, i.e. totals.
