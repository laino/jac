JAP - Just A Polytope
=====================

A library for simulations with large numbers of entities, without actually simulating all of them.

Instead of saving properties on individual entities, properties are treated as a polytopes 
which are simplified as needed - using an algorithm that preserves volume, i.e. totals.
